## Backend
The backend was wraped on Heroku web-service.
The app determines user risk-status and sends that data to the server. After that moment server creates imagined chart, divide it into 2 part and send all data back. That allows app to generate question (showing the first part of the chart) and then perform right answer (showing the second part of the chart).
